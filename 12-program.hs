-- step-wise refinement, or top-down design.
-- We can also go the other way: (Bottom-up design, obviously!)

-- Professional programmers use both of these strategies all the time to piece programs together and solve problems.
--We use processes called equational reasoning, function extraction, dummying, black-boxing (otherwise known as encapsulation) and 
--  refactoring to do these strategies;
